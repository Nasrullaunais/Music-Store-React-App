## Testing

To test the ban feature:

1. **Test Ban Customer**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/admin/customers/1/ban \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"reason":"Testing ban feature","durationInHours":1}'
   ```

2. **Verify Email**: Check that the user receives a ban notification email

3. **Test Login**: Attempt to log in as the banned user (should fail)

4. **Check Status**: Verify ban status through the API

5. **Test Unban**: Unban the user and verify they can log in again

6. **Verify Audit Log**: Check that all actions are properly logged

# User Ban Login Error Handling - Implementation Guide

## Overview
The system now provides user-friendly error messages when banned users attempt to log in. Instead of a generic "invalid credentials" message, users receive detailed information about their ban including the reason and expiration time.

## Backend Implementation

### Error Response Structure

When a banned user tries to log in, the API returns a **403 Forbidden** status with the following response:

```json
{
  "message": "Your account has been temporarily banned",
  "errorType": "ACCOUNT_BANNED",
  "banReason": "Violation of community guidelines",
  "bannedUntil": "2025-10-20T10:30:00",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-19T19:03:52"
}
```

### Status Codes

- **403 Forbidden**: User is banned or disabled
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid username or password
- **200 OK**: Successful login
